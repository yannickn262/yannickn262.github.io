Hi! I'm currently working as a Junior Product Manager / Business Analyst at Bank of America (NYC) under the Market, Sales, and Research technology team.

I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021 (Go Blue!) as an Economics Major & English Minor. I have a huge passion for technology. I love building products and learning about the cutting edge of the tech space. I started out as a Full-Stack Web Developer for just over a year working primarily within the AngularJS (MEAN), C# & .NET tech stack. Then, I switched over to the Product Management side of things when an opportunity arose internally. As a PM, I  communicate with stakeholders to gather requirements, write user stories, manage the backlog, and work with senior product managers to refine the strategy and implementation of new initiatives. Additionally, I was nominated by my manager to work on the Employee Engagement committee where I serve as the Head of Communications & Writing for Market Sales, Research, and Client Facing Technology (MSRCFT). Ultimately, I'm data driven, results-oriented, and a team player who likes to win. I want to work on building products that people love to use.

In my free time, I love to workout, listen to music, and watch an exorbitant amount of movies (AMC A-list). I'm an avid New York Giants & Boston Celtics fan. I'm currently living in the East Village, in Manhattan, and love exploring the restaurant scene.
