I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan who's just embarked on my Data Science journey. I excel at Exploratory Analysis, Data Visualization, and Front-End Web Development. In my freetime, I like to workout, play pickup basketball or anything competitive, bingewatch GOT, It's Always Sunny, Silicon Valley and Entourage, and actively engage in the Ann Arbor school spirit.
