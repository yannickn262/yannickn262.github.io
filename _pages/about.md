I'm currently working as a Product Manager / Product Owner at Bank of America (NYC) under the Market Sales, Research, and Client facing (MSRCFT) technology team.

I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021 (Go Blue!) as an Economics Major & English Minor. I have a huge passion for technology. I started out as a Full-Stack Developer working primarily within the AngularJS (MEAN), C# & .NET tech stack. I switched over to Product Management when an opportunity arose internally. 

As a PM/PO, I work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, define the product vision, road map new intiatives, write user stories, and manage the backlog. I work with senior technology leaders, UX/UI designers, software engineers, and business executives to continously refine the strategy and implementation of new initiatives. 

Additionally, I was nominated by my manager to work on the Employee Engagement committee where I serve as the Head of Communications for our org (MSRCFT).

I'm a results-oriented team player who likes to win. I want to work on building products that people love to use.

In my free time, I love to workout, listen to music, and watch an exorbitant amount of movies (AMC A-list). I'm an avid New York Giants & Boston Celtics fan. I'm currently living in the East Village, in Manhattan, and love exploring the restaurant scene.
