I'm a rising Junior at the University of Michigan who's just embarked on my Data Science journey. I excel at Exploratory Analysis, Data Visualization, and Front-End Web Development. In my freetime, I workout (kinda), play pickup basketball (or anything competitive), bingewatch shows such as GOT/Breaking Bad, and Entourage. Finally, I like to go out and actively engage with Ann Arbor's School Spirit.
