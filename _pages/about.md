Hi! I'm currently working as a Business Analyst/Junior Product Manager at Bank of America (NYC) under the Market, Sales, and Research technology team.
I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021 (Go Blue!) as an Economics Major & English Minor. I have a huge passion for technology. I love building products and learning about the cutting edge of the tech space. I excel at Exploratory Analysis, Data Visualization, and Full-Stack Web Development. I'm data driven, results-oriented, and a team player who likes to win. I want to work on building products that people love to use.

In my free time, I love to workout, listen to music, and watch an exorbitant amount of movies (AMC). I'm an avid New York Giants & Boston Celtics fan. I'm currently living in the East Village in Manhattan & love exploring the restaurant scene.
