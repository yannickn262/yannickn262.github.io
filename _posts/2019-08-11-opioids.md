Exploratory Data Visualization: Opioid Epidemic

### This project was started roughly halfway through my internship at Florida Blue Cross. This project was particularly important to me as I've seen in my own community how drug addiction doesn't discriminate regardless of intelligence levels, income, race, and age. The dilemma for an insurance company that wants to help these people is that most of the people on hard drugs currently don't have insurance. Michael Hufford Dean of Graduate Studies at Pitt's Public Health School corroborates that many people who are currently on street drugs end up getting priced out of prescription drugs forcing them to turn to the more affordable high. The goal of the project was to find trends within the opioid crisis at various demographic levels. Thus by comparing the results to the demographics of a particular community we will receive context for the data that allow us to identify trends with higher accuracy. If given more time, it'd be interesting to cross reference overdose data with socioeconomic status data and then use sklearn to create a predictive model that identifies individuals at the highest risk of transitioning from prescription drugs to street drugs.

### This is a small polynomial regression fitted curve with scipy and sklearn. The trend curve looks overfitted, but I won't be able to officially know that unless I run the program with a different dataset. Overall, I wish I got more time to work on the project. However, it was awesome to get to work on something meaningful, and I walked out of the office having a solid foundation in python and extensive knowledge on arguably the biggest public health epidemic in modern day U.S. History.
