This project was built in early June 2019. I got bored in the summer and figured I ought to create something. Through the simple bookstore application, I was able to gain familiarity with writing sql CRUD operations through sqlite3 and incorporating them with a python based frontend. Overall, it wouldn't been have possible without the Udemy course by Arduit Slice.
