I'm a Product Manager / Business Analyst at Bank of America (NYC) for the Institutional Research Platform under Markets, Sales, Research, and Client Facing Technology (MSRCFT).

As a PM/BA, I communicate with stakeholders, define the product vision, road map new intiatives, write user stories, and manage the backlog. I work with senior technology leaders and business executives to continously refine the strategy and implementation of new initiatives. 

I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021 (Go Blue!) as an Economics Major & English Minor. I have a passion for technology. I love building products and learning about the cutting edge of tech. I started out as a Full-Stack Developer working primarily within the AngularJS (MEAN), C# & .NET tech stack. I switched over to Product Management when an opportunity arose internally. 

Additionally, I was nominated by my manager to work on the Employee Engagement committee where I serve as the Head of Communications & Writing for MSRCFT.

I'm data driven, results-oriented, and a team player who likes to win. I want to work on building products that people love to use.

In my free time, I workout, listen to music, and watch an exorbitant amount of movies (AMC A-list). I'm an avid New York Giants & Boston Celtics fan. I currently live in the East Village and love exploring the restaurant scene.
